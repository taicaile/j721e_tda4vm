1. This bin folder contains board-specific directories for each of the combined_opt.appimage/
combined_dev.appimage output builds. 
2. Each board specific folder also contains bl31.bin,
bl32.bin, Image, u-boot-spl.bin base-board.dtb which are used to generate combined_dev.appimage
and combined_opt.appimage.
3. Note : base-board.dtb needs to be modified to ensure that a SD card filesystem ('rootfs) 
is specified for the Linux filesystem in each case. base-board.dtb file need to be 
updated for every release.

How to Modify base-boad.dtb :
1. Clone ti-linux-kernel repo - https://bitbucket.itg.ti.com/projects/LCPDPUB/repos/ti-linux-kernel/browse
2. Add "root=/dev/mmcblk1p2 rw rootfstype=ext4 rootwait" to bootargs in arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-<soc_name>-common-proc-board.dts
3. Execute the following command - make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- defconfig ti_arm64_prune.config -j8
4. Execute the following command - make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- dtbs -j8
5. You can find the image at arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-<board_name>-common-proc-board.dtb
6. Rename k3-<board_name>-common-proc-board.dtb as base-board.dtb and copy to board specific folder under board directory


NOTE : For J721E you need to disable the serdes in device tree since serdes already being initialized by SBL. Make the below changes along with step2 mentioned above.

Add 'status = "disabled";' for serdes0, serdes1, serdes2
