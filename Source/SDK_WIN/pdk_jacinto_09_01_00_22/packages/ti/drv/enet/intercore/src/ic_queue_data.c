 * \brief System-wide inter-core queue table handle
 * 
 *  Handle to the system-wide shared inter-core queue table. This object must be
 *  initialized once at the SOC level, by the master core. All cores must refer
 *  to queue table using this handle.
 *
 *  If the queues are being used in a multi-core scenario, as in this case,
 *  this data structure must be allocated in non-cacheable memory or kept
 *  cache-coherent
