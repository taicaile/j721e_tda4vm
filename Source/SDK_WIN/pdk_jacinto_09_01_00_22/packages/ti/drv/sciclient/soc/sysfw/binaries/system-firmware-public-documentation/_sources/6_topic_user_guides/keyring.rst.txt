Introduction
============

The extended keyring enables the generic data blob to be signed/verified with userâ€™s
 auxiliary key other than the root key (i.e. SMPK/BMPK).

.. _dref_sec_keyring_background:

Background on Use-cases
=======================

The following describes the use-cases which substantiate the need for 
keyring within SMS and drive the design decisions described later in this
document.

* Import auxiliary public keys' hash presented in the form of a signed x509 certificate
  after validation.
* The imported keys' hash can be used to authenticate the signed firmware or data blobs
  presented to |sysfw|.

.. _dref_sec_keyring_func-goals:

Functional Goals
================

Keyring provides the following functionality:

1.  APIs to import the entire keyring in to TIFS internal memory.
2. |sysfw| can use the keys imported from the extended key ring,
	during the signed firmware or data blob authentication.

Design
======

Keyring design is described in the following sections

.. _dref_sec_keyring_storage:

Key Data Storage
----------------

The keyring exists in a carved out section of SMS internal memory with
a build-time configurable size. The keyring memory contains following 
information:

* Internal state of the keyring. This is only initialized and transitioned
  inside |sysfw|.  It is meaningless from the host perspective and should be
  treated as reserved.  

* Array of metadata descriptors for the keys in the keyring.
  The descriptors for the key slots specify:

.. list-table:: Parameters of public keys
   :align: center
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Keyring parameters
     - Description 

   * - key_type
     - flag to indicate if key is symmetric or asymmetric
   
   * - keyid
     - keyid of the key
   
   * - imageauth
     - flag to indicate if key can be used for firmware image authentication
   
   * - debugauth
     - flag to indicate if key can be used for debug certificate authentication
   
   * - reserved
     - for internal use   

   * - esmpkh  
     - esmpk hash for authentication  

.. _dref_keyring_data_structure:

The above information is placed at the base of the keyring memory. This can be
more concisely represented by the C-code definition of the keyring structure for 
asymmetric keys:

.. code-block:: c

  struct keyring_asymm {
        struct aux_pk {
          uint8_t key_type;
          uint8_t key_id;				
          uint8_t imageauth;
          uint8_t debugauth;
          uint8_t reserved[4];
        } aux_pk;
        uint8_t   esmpkh[64];
    } 

.. _dref_sec_keyring_provision:

Keyring Import
--------------

Early in the lifecycle of the HS device, the customer will use the keywriter to
blow the eFuse with Secondary MPKH and MEK (among other contents) and
transition the device from HS-FS state to HS-SE. At this point, the keyring 
contents have not yet been populated and it is up to the system software owner
to provision an initial set of keys.  This is achieved through a bulk import of
the keyring contents which have been appended to an x509 certificate signed with the 
active customer MPK, similar to how one signs an encrypted binary for secure boot. 
Validation of the certificate ensures that the keyring contents are trustworthy and 
can hence be stored into the reserved memory. If the certificate check fails then
provisioning will not be successful and the keyring will remain unitialized.

The host is responsibile for ensuring that the keyring data is properly
formatted when creating the payload for the keyring import API. If not, the data
will be interpreted differently between the host and |sysfw| which can cause
unpredictable values for the various fields in the structure. The data
corruption may cause following failures in subsequent key operations:

* Key type is not correct, so operations checking for the key type will fail.
* The key id of each key must be between and including values 1-254, else the keyring import
  will fail.
* Usage flags are not correct, so usage permissions checks will fail.

Keyring import operation requires following constraints:

* The number of keys in the certificate extension must match the number of keys
  present in the keyring.
* Without a certificate extension, keyring import will fail. 
* The number of asymmetric keys should be between and including values 1-6.
* Keyring can only be imported once, and any further attempts will fail.
