Introduction
============

This chapter provides information on the set of HostIDs permitted
in this J7200 SoC. HostIDs uniquely identify each logically distinct high level
software entity. A software entity identification number (HostID) can be
assigned to an OS either native or virtualized, or a firmware/native
application. The HostID is used to select the set of Secure Proxy channels for
which this software entity should use to communicate with the System Firmware.

As an example with an R5 core, then there could be 0, 1, or n number of
R5 related hosts. The only limit is the number of available Secure Proxy
Channels. Typically though, an R5 core will be assigned one secure host as well as one non
secure host, but may be assigned additional hosts for certain usecases. As for other
cores, some will only use secure hosts, and others will only use non secure hosts.
Since the hosts are tied to Secure Proxy Channels, hosts are just a way of sectioning
off data for a designated purpose.

System Firmware also checks that the used HostID comes from software running
on the correct core (as implied by Host Name in the below table) and with the
correct security level (Security Status column).

Additionally, one of the key reasons why HostID is tied in with Secure Proxy
channels is because it prevents spoofing. When a message is received by
System Firmware, the Secure Proxy channel tied to the HostID in the message is
verified against the Secure Proxy channel on which the message was received.
Specifically, only the HostID listed in the "Host Name" column can use the Secure
Proxy channel associated with it.

.. note::

   * Description provides an intended purpose
     of the host ID, though on some systems,
     this might be used differently, backing memory and
     link allocations are made with the specified purpose
     in mind
   * Security Status provides an intended purpose for the
     Host context
