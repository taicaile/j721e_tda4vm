 *
 *  System Configuration APIs are used to put the module to a desired
 *  power state as specified by the power spread sheet. It abstracts
 *  the programming of PRCM registers to enable/disable or auto clock
 *  gate a given module. Many modules can be programmed in one go by providing
 *  the list of modules and their desired power state.
 *
 *  The system configuration does not take care of dependencies between
 *  modules and it is the user’s responsibility to maintain the right
 *  dependency order to switch off a given module vs another.
