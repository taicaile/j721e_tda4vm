/**
 *   \ingroup PM_LIB PM LIB API
 *   \defgroup CPU_IDLE CPU Idle Configuration
 *      Dynamic power management of the CPUs involves setting the
 *      CPU power state to a lower power state when the CPU has
 *      nothing to do and then wake up from the low power state
 *      when the CPU has to resume its operations.
 *
 *      The CPU context is maintained every time the CPU goes to
 *      low power mode. Interrupts which are configured during the
 *      normal CPU operation can be configured as wakeup events which
 *      bring the CPU out of its low power state.
 *
 *      Some recommended power states for the different CPUs is as below:
 *      \n    - MPU : Subsystem Retention
 *      \n    - IPU : Subsystem Auto Clock Gate
 *      \n    - DSP : Subsystem Auto Clock Gate
 *      \n    - EVE : Subsystem Auto Clock Gate
