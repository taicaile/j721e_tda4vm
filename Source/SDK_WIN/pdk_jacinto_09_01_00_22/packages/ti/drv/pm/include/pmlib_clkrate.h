 *
 * Initialization of the device involves setting the right frequency
 * for the clocks for the CPUs and peripherals and right voltage for
 * the voltage rails.
 *
 * The initialization of the system is carried in 3 stages:
 *  - Setting the AVS class-0 voltage and ABB voltage at boot from the SBL
 *    (\ref PM_HAL_VM)
 *  - Configuring the DPLL, multiplexer and dividers at boot time from the SBL
 *    (\ref PM_HAL_CM)
 *  - Configuring peripheral, Video Pll and CPU frequency at run time with
 *    necessaryvoltage changes. This is taken care by the
 *    PMLIB Clock Rate Configuration APIs.
 *
 * The Clock Rate Configuration provides 2 APIs to set and get the frequency
 * of any clock of any given module.
 * - PMLIBClkRateGet()
 * - PMLIBClkRateSet()
