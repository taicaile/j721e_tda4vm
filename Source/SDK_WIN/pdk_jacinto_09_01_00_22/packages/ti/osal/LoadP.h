 *
 *          This function is called, every "configLOAD_WINDOW_IN_MS" msecs within the IDLE task.
 *          It is important that idle task get to run atleast once every "configLOAD_WINDOW_IN_MS" msecs
 *          for the load statistics to be correct
 *          
 *          In case of FreeRTOS, FreeRTOSConfig.h enables update in idle
 *          and idle task calls this API.
 *          FreeRTOSConfig.h:-
 * 
 *              #define configLOAD_UPDATE_IN_IDLE   (1)
 *              #define configLOAD_WINDOW_IN_MS     (500)
